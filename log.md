# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up some missing routes and pushed all of chesmsbl.org to GitHub

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get cracking on #100daysofCode to help keep me on track for side projects. I've also rallied a few friends, @soldierforus and @jwsummers. I'm looking forward to collaborating on a future project with them. I'm not happy that I'm throwing together the chesmsbl.org site with an express + pug application, but it has allowed me to move very quickly. Hopefully I can switch it over to react + redux in the next couple of weeks.

### Day 2: January 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Fixed 404 route, enabled forced https, updated user model

**Thoughts:** I spent my work day more excited to to work on #100daysofcode projects than on my actual work. Thait's probably because I was knee deep in Google Sheets, Jira Tickets, and GitHub commits. @jwsummers came over for dinner and I spent a solid hour just walking through the express application, explaining it's various parts and how they apply to web application development. I'd like to have him add a some static content, as an exercise in learning.
